                Gurudev Shri Kanji Swami delivered tens of thousands of Pravachans throughout his lifetime, with over 9,500 publicly available today on vitragvani.com. Many spiritual seekers (Mumukshus) begin their day by listening to them. Beyond the original scriptures by our Acharyas, Muniraaj, and Gyaani Vidvaan, his Pravachans are a unique source that comprehensively discuss the core spiritual concepts of Jain Philosophy (द्रव्यानुयोग / आध्यात्म).

                His Pravachans are delivered in an accessible language and delve into fundamental topics of Jain Spirituality, such as:
            </p>
            <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 text-ink list-disc">
                <li className="mb-1">Dravya-Gun-Paryay</li>
                <li className="mb-1">Nischay - Vyavhar</li>
                <li className="mb-1">Nimitt - Upadan</li>

                <li className="mb-1">Way to attain self-experience (आत्मानुभूति)</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="mb-8 text-ink leading-relaxed">
                The importance of these Pravachans is underscored by the fact that most have been transcribed word-for-word into PDFs in both Gujarati and Hindi. This facilitates understanding for spiritual seekers (मुमुक्षु) who listen to the audio Pravachans. Together with the audio files, these Pravachan Scriptures (प्रवचन शास्त्र) are a vital source of spiritual knowledge.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-ink mb-6">Why Swalakshya Chat?</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-ink leading-relaxed">
                Swalakshya Chat was developed to help spiritual seekers (मुमुक्षु) easily navigate and search through Gurudevshri's vast collection of Pravachans, aiding their spiritual study (स्वाध्याय). It is designed for spiritual seekers, researchers, and Jain Scholars (विद्वान) alike.
            </p>

                    <strong>Spiritual Seekers:</strong> This portal allows spiritual seekers to find answers to common questions by posing them in Hindi, English, or Gujarati. Swalakshya Chat uses AI to provide relevant answers directly from Gurudev's Pravachans. For instance, a user can ask, <strong>"दृष्टि के विषय और ज्ञान के विषय में क्या अन्तर है?"</strong> and Swalakshya Chat will provide references from Gurudev's entire catalog that address this question. Users can also search using specific keywords, such as <strong>"महात्मा गाँधी"</strong> to find all references where Gurudev mentioned Mahatma Gandhi.
                </li>
                <li className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Jain Scholars and Researchers:</strong> Gurudev's words are considered a definitive authority on Jain Spirituality. Jain Scholars and researchers frequently reference Gurudev's Pravachans to support their arguments. They also study his Pravachan Shastra for research, to learn about events in Gurudev's life, or to understand the examples he used to explain concepts.
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-ink mb-6">How Does Swalakshya Chat Work?</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-ink leading-relaxed">
                Swalakshya Chat employs OCR technology to convert all PDF files into text files. This text is then indexed into a search-engine system (called OpenSearch). When a user enters a query, Swalakshya Chat performs two operations:
            </p>

            <ul className="mb-8 ml-6 text-ink list-disc">
                <li className="mb-2"><strong>Keyword Search:</strong> Matches all references containing the input keywords.</li>
                <li className="mb-2"><strong>Semantic Search:</strong> Uses AI to find all relevant references that semantically match the answer to the input query.</li>
            </ul>


            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-ink mb-6">Why Use Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-ink leading-relaxed">
                A crucial question arises: Should artificial technology be used with such important content? Gurudev's Pravachans are akin to our Teerthankar's Vaani—how can AI be used to interpret their words?
            </p>
            <p className="mb-8 text-ink leading-relaxed">
                The short answer is that AI is not used to interpret Gurudev's words or his intention. Instead, AI serves merely as a tool to identify references that <em>possibly</em> match the input questions, providing direct references from Gurudev's Pravachans. Swalakshya Chat generates answers which are strongly backed with Jain Shastras and Gurudev's Pravachans. It provides word-for-word references from these texts with each answer. This helps in finding answers from Jain Aagam easily.
